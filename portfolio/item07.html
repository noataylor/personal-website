Writing to the track which is over 3.5 Kilometres long. That’s a lot of writing and a lot of data.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To many, writing to a DVD or CD feels like a thing of the past. Many modern computers no longer have built in disc readers, partly due to the advent of the internet. So using hardware from more than ten years ago feels rather old fashioned. But sometimes, it is necessary to make use of such techniques precisely because it is not possible to burn a DVD or CD without the required hardware.</p>
	  <p>I’m not suggesting that we start using floppy disks again. I’ve only ever seen the smaller, non-floppy ones. But maybe they have their uses.</p>

	  <p>In a sense, therefore, it is a question of accessibility. If I produce a CD my audience changes. On the one hand, anyone with the CD can access the files. They do not need a computer, just a CD reader (depending on what is on the CD). This is good because it gets outside of the digital divide endemic to data which is accessible only via the internet.</p>

	  <p>That said, I remember when HMV went into administration because people just stopped buying CDs. Nowadays we have streaming services which provide digital media to people all over the world in a streamed format. A throwback to optical discs sounds absurd. However, there is something significant about optical discs, especially in my own experience of using technology.</p>

<p>As such, I am trying to communicate the feeling of burning a disc because it is a distinctive activity with a specific set of accompanying and evoked feelings and processes. In some ways these are a thing of the past and carry a nostalgic quality. In other regards, it is eminently practical and engages with assumptions about what we think of when we think of data and its readability. The fact is, I can produce something which never touches the internet and save it to a disc and get it to someone or somewhere else with a level of privacy which cannot be attained or ensured over the internet. Obviously, the internet has a lot of security levels and some might argue that it is in fact safer to store things online. However, I think it Is generally accepted that physical copies of data are more secure than online ones, depending on where you keep it.</p>
