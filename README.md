Introduction
------------

At the outset of this research project I intended to conduct interviews regarding community arts interventions in the South West of England. Exploring connections between immigration and health care from a lifeworld perspective in relation to performance arts was an explict aim. I chose these research areas on the basis of University units I was studying contemporaneously.



Research Questions
------------------

To explore parallels between govenment policy on healthcare and migration through practice-led research, I posed the following questions:

- Is there a bridge which would take one from government legislation focussed on protecting public health to a 'drive' which aims to propagate anti-immigration ideology at a sub-state strata?

- Could an affirmation of existential freedom conjure up resistance to the (full temporal scope of) such an ideological machine / apparatus whilst facilitating cultural recovery?

-  As a perfomative, digital methodology, how might writing, through an inscription of such freedom, promote social wellbeing, freedom of movement and participation in international communities? 



Cultural And Industrial Connections
-----------------------------------

To research these questions further, I attended and wrote during seminars specifcally relevant to migration, performance and health. This included a workshop with Arts and Health South West; an online seminar on moving through Eurospace; and a lecture by Elena Fiddian-Qasmiyeh on refugee-hosts.



Theory and Critical Reflection
------------------------------

Julia Kristeva (1984:195) suggests that 'signifying practice', in contrast to 'signifying experience', is always rooted in a social dimension. Indeed, the social aspect of these events was a strong motivator in my decision to attend and participation was socially engaging. Nevertheless, I discovered some shortcomings in my research practice. My reliance on proprietary software produced numermous design limitations, such as a lack of engagement with non-human languages during the production of texts. Thus, Alain Badiou offers an indirect critque of Kristevan practice. He writes:

'For poetic ontology, which---like History---finds itself in an impasse of an excess of presence, one in which being conceals itself, it is necessary to substitute mathematical ontology, in which dis-qualification and unpresentation are realized through writing.'


Consequently, going beyond human language through the writing of technical code became a key method for performing socially rooted practice in open source contexts.



Conclusion
----------

In my experience and practice of exploring the questions above I concluded that state powers pervade migration processes and national healthcare systems. There is tension and interplay in politics and legislation between between healthcare and immigration policy. For example, a state can ratify and ramify emergency legislation aimed to protect public health, such as closing national borders, effectively preventing migration. Such techniques of closure can simultaneously devastate cultural industries and individual freedoms.

I intend to continue visiting rigorous, open source methodologies, such as engaging with multiple human and non-human langages in writing, when conducting upcoming interviews or recording ethnographic fieldnotes in future. Philsophically, I am interested to explore how different conceptions of 'source' or 'origin' outlined by Foucault in 'Nietzsche, Genealogy, History' 'withtain'[1] relevance to open source practices.
